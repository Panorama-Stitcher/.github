Build clean panos fast with Panorama Stitcher for Mac. Drop your set, auto-detect overlap, and align with parallax-aware matching. Switch between perspective, cylindrical, spherical, or planar projections, level the horizon, and crop smartly. Ghost suppression and exposure/vignette fixes keep seams invisible. Export 8/16-bit
