## 🧭 Overview (Expanded)

**Panorama Stitcher** is a Mac-native studio for turning overlapping photos into **seamless panoramas**—from handheld phone sweeps to **gigapixel** mosaics captured on rails. It automates the technical grind (feature detection, alignment, distortion compensation, exposure fusion) while giving you **surgical control** when scenes get tricky (parallax near objects, mixed lighting, repeating textures).

Under the hood, the app analyzes each image for **stable keypoints** (corners, edges, textures) and matches them robustly even when exposure or white balance drifts between frames. It estimates **lens model + camera path**, then picks a projection that preserves your subject—**cylindrical** for wide landscapes with minimal vertical stretch, **spherical** for 360°/VR, **perspective** for architectural lines, or **planar** for flat art. You can switch projections instantly and watch geometry relax into shape while straight-line guards keep horizons level.

Real scenes are messy; Panorama Stitcher leans into that. **Adaptive alignment** handles slight zoom or focus breathing; **parallax mitigation** reduces seams when foregrounds shift against backgrounds; **ghost suppression** chooses a single source for moving subjects (people, waves, leaves) so duplicates don’t appear. With **exposure matching + vignetting compensation**, sky gradients stay smooth and walls don’t blotch at overlaps. If a frame truly doesn’t fit, smart outlier rejection drops it without wrecking the whole pano.

The canvas is built for **speed** and **clarity**. A live preview shows seam quality, alignment confidence, and potential ghosts. Crop suggestions remove blank borders automatically, but you can expand, rotate, or set a custom horizon with a single drag. When you need precision, open the **control-point editor**: add or nudge a couple of points on stubborn surfaces (e.g., brick, tiles, glass) and the solver re-optimizes instantly. For HDR brackets, the app can **fuse exposure stacks per viewpoint** before stitching, or stitch each exposure then blend globally—both workflows are one click.

Export is production-ready: 8/16-bit **TIFF/PNG/JPEG**, embedded color profiles (**sRGB/Adobe RGB/Display P3**), layered **PSD** with masks for later retouching, and tiled big-pano output for print houses. File naming tokens and **recipes** keep batches consistent (great for real estate and e-commerce). Whether your input is a casual coastal sweep or a tripod mosaic of a cathedral nave, Panorama Stitcher gets you to a clean, natural pano **fast**—with fewer halos, fewer ghosts, and less time in Photoshop.

## 🛠 How It Works (Plain-English)

1. **Drop your photos** (in order or not).  
2. The app **finds overlap**, estimates lens + camera motion, and picks a sane projection.  
3. It **matches exposure/vignetting**, hides ghosts, and merges seams.  
4. You **tweak horizon/crop**, change projection if needed, and approve.  
5. **Export** at print/web size, 8/16-bit, with profiles and naming you choose.

## 🧪 Capture Guide (Better Inputs = Better Panos)

- **Overlap 30–50%** per frame; more in low-texture scenes (sky, water, blank walls).  
- **Lock exposure/WB/focus** when possible; for HDR, use consistent bracket steps.  
- **Pivot around the entrance pupil** (aka nodal point) to reduce parallax for near objects.  
- Keep the **horizon level**; a simple bubble level saves minutes later.  
- For interiors, shoot an **extra frame of the floor/ceiling** to help the solver.  
- Avoid moving crowds; or shoot **burst sequences** to minimize subject drift.

## 🧩 Real-World Workflows

- **Landscape sweep:** 12 handheld frames → auto cylindrical → auto crop → 16-bit TIFF for grading.  
- **Real estate room:** 2 rows × 6 frames on tripod → perspective projection with vertical guards → layered PSD export.  
- **Flat art:** Planar projection + de-warp → TIFF at 600 DPI for archival print.  
- **HDR sunset:** Fuse brackets per view → stitch → tone map in your editor of choice.  
- **360° foyer:** Full spherical pano → equirectangular export for web viewer.

1. Drag your set into the window.  
2. Hit **Stitch** → preview builds automatically.  
3. Switch projection if needed; level horizon.  
4. **Auto-crop** → check seam/ghost overlay.  
5. Export **16-bit TIFF** (print) or **JPEG** (web) with the right profile.

## ❓ FAQ

**Can I mix portrait and landscape frames?**  
Yes—auto layout handles mixed orientations; just ensure healthy overlap.

**Does it fix lens distortion?**  
Yes—estimates radial distortion and compensates during alignment.

**What about handheld parallax?**  
Ghost suppression + parallax mitigation reduce artifacts; for near foregrounds, pivot carefully or add control points.

**Can I export 360°?**  
Yes—spherical projection outputs standard equirectangular images.
